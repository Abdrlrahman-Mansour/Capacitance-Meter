# Capacitance Meter

## Overview

The **Capacitance Meter** is an embedded systems project designed to measure and display the capacitance of electronic components accurately. This project uses an Arduino microcontroller to process the capacitance measurements and displays the results on a 7-seg display.

## Features

- Accurate measurement of capacitance values.
- User-friendly display of measurement results on an 7-seg.
- Supports a range of capacitance values.
- Simple calibration and adjustment options.

## Hardware Requirements

- **Microcontroller:** Arduino (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- **Display:** 7-seg
- **Capacitor:** Component under test
- **Resistor:** 10k ohms (or appropriate value for your circuit)
- **Miscellaneous:** Breadboard, jumper wires, power supply

## Software Requirements

- **IDE:** Atmel Studio
- **Libraries:** LiquidCrystal library for seven-segment

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdrlrahman-Mansour/Capacitance-Meter.git
